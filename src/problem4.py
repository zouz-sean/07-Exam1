    What comes in:  Positive integer m.
    What goes out:  Returns the number of non-trival FACTORS of m, where:
      -- a FACTOR of m is a positive integer that divides evenly into m
      -- the TRIVIAL factors of m are 1 and m, and the NON-TRIVIAL factors
           of m are all the factors EXCEPT the trivial ones.
    Side effects:   None.
    Examples:
      -- problem4(10)  returns 2  because 10 has 2 non-trivial factors,
                                      namely: 2 and 5.
      -- problem4(24)  returns 6  because 24 has 6 non-trivial factors,
                                      namely: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12.
      -- problem4(13)  returns 0  because  7 has no non-trivial factors.
      -- problem4(30)  returns 6  because 30 has 6 non-trivial factors,
                                      namely: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 15.
      -- problem4(360) returns 22
            because 360 has 22  non-trivial factors,
            namely:  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  8,  9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30,
                    36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, and 180.
      -- problem4(97)   returns 0 because 97 has no non-trivial factors
